# This is a work in progress.

Make sure you have the required programs installed to run:
> Python


> Docker-compose

How to run,
cd into main directory (Where the Dockerfile is)
then run:

> sudo docker-compose up --build

Then go to chrome and type: 
http://0.0.0.0:5000/ 

right now there is nothing on the website.

This is activate the dockerfile and make it run.
